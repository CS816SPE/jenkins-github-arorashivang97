# jenkins-github Assignment
- Create a simple Job, and the build action of the job can be something simple like ```echo "Hello World!"```
- Connect the job to your GitHub Assignment repository using Git SCM Poll for every 5 seconds
- Whenever you commit to your repository, the Jenkins job should run automatically.

NOTE: My Ubuntu system was a day ahead i.e. 31st January 2019. So all my images have that date. Sorry for the inconvenience.
